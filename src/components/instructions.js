      <h1>Summation operation of a series of random numbers</h1>
      <p>Create a web page with ReactJS.</p>
      <p>
        A “Start” button for users to trigger a new operation where a series of
        random numbers between 1 to 9 will be generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first number generated will determine the number of subsequent
        digits to be needed for the sum operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The output on the page will display the numbers generated and the result
        of the summation.
      </p>
      <p>Example 1:</p>
      <p>1st number : 4</p>
      <p>Next four numbers generated : 6, 7, 2, 5</p>
      <p>666666 + 7777777 + 22 + 55555 = 8500020</p>
      <p>Example 2:</p>
      <p> 1st number : 6</p>
      <p>Next six numbers generated : 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 2</p>
      <p>333 + 22 + 1 + 7777777 + 88888888 + 22 = 96667043 </p>
